    "### What is a database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is just somewhere for us to store our data. There are many different shapes and sizes of database. SQL is a language which is often used to query these databases and thatâ€™s what we will be learning today.\n",

    "    \n",
    "The possibilities are truly vast: customers and customer orders. Climate sampling sites and climate data gathered there.\n",

    "</details>\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    " What sorts of manipulations do we make to data in databases?\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Create** (at some point, usually before we are involved, data goes into a database)\n",
    " - **Read** (we need to get data out to perform analyses)\n",
    " - **Update** (occasionally, we may need to be able to change data)\n",
    " - **Delete** (occasionally, we need to be able to remove data from our database)\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to these four operations as **\"CRUD\"**. As data analysts, we are naturally most interested in **Read**ing from databases: we want to import data into an analysis environment and produce useful and actionable insights. But, we'll briefly show you how to perform the other three operations, just so you have seen them in action! \n",

    "### Why databases are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Databases *can store very large numbers of records efficiently* (they take up little space).\n",
    "2. It is *very quick* and easy to find information.\n",
    "3. It is *easy to add new data and to edit or delete* old data.\n",
    "4. Data *can be searched easily*, eg 'find all Ford cars'.\n",
    "5. Data *can be sorted easily*, for example into 'date first registered' order.\n",
    "6. Data *can be imported into other applications*, for example a mail-merge letter to a customer saying that an MOT test is due.\n",
    "7. *More than one person can access the same database* at the same time - multi-access.\n",
    "8. *Security may be better* than in paper files.\n",

    "### What is SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"SQL\" stands for \"Structured Query Language\" (pronounced either as \"ess-queue-ell\" or \"sequel\"). There are number of different 'versions' of SQL in common use: some freely available and others proprietary. You should be aware that there are lots of different versions of SQL out there: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of each of the versions tends to be the same, and it's really only core functionality we'll be looking at here!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, a database is a collection of **tables**. A table is a collection of **columns** and **rows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A table describes the type of item that we want to store. \n",
    "* A column represents some information we might find interesting about that item. \n",
    "* A row is the physical data we want to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have a `zoo` database with a table called `animals`. The `animals` table might have the columns `name`, `age` and `species`, and we'll also add in an `animal_id` column to keep track of individual animals. The `animals` table would then have rows of data like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| `animal_id` | `name` | `age` | `species` |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1 | Leo | 12 | Lion |\n",
    "| 2 | Tony | 8 | Tiger |\n",
    "| 3 | Matilda | 6 | Cow |\n",
    "| 4 | Winnie  | 12 | Bear |"

    "\n",
    "### Table relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the tables in a database are **related** to each other in some fashion, and in fact people often use the terms 'SQL database' and 'relational database' interchangeably, as virtually all relational databases use SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of a relationship. Imagine we expand our `zoo` database by adding a `diets` table to help the zookeepers track what to feed each animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "| `diet_id` | `diet_type` |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1 | herbivore |\n",
    "| 2 | carnivore |\n",
    "| 3 | omnivore |\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good. But now we need to say **which diet each animal should receive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote class='task'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the two tables we have in the database so far: `animals` and `diets`. Can you see how to change the database to indicate which diet each animal in the `zoo` should receive?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:**\n",
    "We need to add something to the `animals` table. Can you think what?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "We need to **add an extra column** to the `animals` table, like so\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| `animal_id` | `name` | `age` | `species` | `diet_id` |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",

    "| 2 | Tony | 8 | Tiger | 2 |\n",
    "| 3 | Matilda | 6 | Cow | 1 |\n",
    "| 4 | Bernice | 12 | Bear | 3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes a **relationship** between the two tables! Every row in the `animals` table is now linked to a row in the `diets` table.\n",
